Basic Struturing:
    ->HTML and css

    -> Canvas API(Browser) 
        HTML element to perform drawing graphics
        1. TOOL => Api to draw graphics
        2. strokeStyle => color
        3. lineWidth => thickness
        4. tool.beginPath() => sets a new Path for a new graphic 
        5. tool.moveTO(x1,y1) => defines the start point of the graphic (x,y)
        6. tool.lineTo(x2,y2) => defines the end point of the graphic till (x2,y2);
        7. tool.stroke() => fills with color

    -> mouse ke hisaab se path define krna hai (mouseListener
    
    -> socket.io  -? realtime Dataflow
